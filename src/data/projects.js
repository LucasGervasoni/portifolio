Built without modern tools like Flexbox or Grid Layout, the page used float and position for layout, with well-structured HTML and features like modal, alert, and automatic scrolling implemented in JavaScript. The project was a challenge that strengthened my understanding of legacy techniques, improved my ability to navigate official documentation, and prepared me to tackle different development approaches. Later, I added responsiveness using Flexbox.",
